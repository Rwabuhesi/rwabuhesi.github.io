In here is my project work for the Google Africa Front End Developer track

The Pixel Art Maker is a single page webapp that a user uses to create a grid canvas and dynamically set the grid size, ie the number of rows and columns in the grid canvas
The user can then select the color of choice from the color piker and fill it in a cell on the grid by clicking on the cell. She can double-click the cell to remove the color
She can then use the grid to create pixellated art using the select color(s)

Do interact with the app at rwabuhesi.github.io/
